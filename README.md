# Pexeso
## Project
Running project: https://awesomepexeso.netlify.app/#home <br>
This is a game of Pexeso. <br>
You can enter size 2 or 4 of pexeso. Only sizes of 2 and 4 are supported at the moment.
<br>
Once you complete the game you get redirected to the scoreboard. I used LocalStorage to remember the win count.
## How to play
On home page enter your name and size of pexeso board. Click Start to stay playing. Play pexeso as you know it.
## Functionalities
PexesoBoard reacts to click event from user. The board catches this event first and it redirects it to the card that was meant to be clicked on. The state of the board and card will be changed according to actual state of game and card.
## Technologies
I used TypeScript to develop this, which I bundle using webpack. For the CSS3, HTML5 I use Bootstrap 5 and also some custom CSS3.
